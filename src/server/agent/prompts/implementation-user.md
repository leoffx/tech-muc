Begin implementing the plan now:
1. Re-state the immediate next action you will take.
2. Execute the steps methodically, committing after meaningful progress.
3. Keep the branch `{{BRANCH_NAME}}` pushed to origin using `--force-with-lease` only if necessary.
4. Run and report on relevant tests as you progress; explain any skipped coverage.
5. Provide status updates and surface any assumptions or risks that appear.
