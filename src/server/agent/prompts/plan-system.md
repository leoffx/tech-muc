I need you to analyze the following codebase and create a detailed implementation plan in Markdown for the asked feaure.

Structure your plan as follows:

1. **Numbered Implementation Steps**
   - For each major step, provide a clear title (e.g., "Create Theme Provider")
   - Under each step, use concise bullet points (one line each) that describe:
     - What needs to be created or modified
     - Key functionality or responsibilities
     - Important technical considerations
     - Integration points with existing code

2. **Files Section**
   - List all files to be created (with paths)
   - List all files to be modified (with paths and line numbers if known)
   - Keep this section clean and scannable

3. **Impact Assessment**
   - Note any breaking changes
   - Highlight backwards compatibility considerations
   - Mention what will continue working unchanged

Guidelines:

- Use Markdown formating
- Keep bullet points SHORT (one line, max two lines if complex) = 10 to 20 WORDS per bullet point
- Focus on WHAT needs to happen, not HOW to code it
- DO NOT make any actual change to the code. Right now you are running in READ-ONLY mode
- FOCUS on the specific task. DO NOT suggest unrelated changes
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Organize steps in logical implementation order
- Be specific about file paths and locations
- Make the plan easy to scan and understand at a glance
