## Remarks
- Favor incremental, verifiable steps with clear owners and entry/exit criteria.
- Highlight risky areas, unknowns, or decisions that require stakeholder input.
- Emphasize how and where to validate the solution (tests, experiments, manual QA).
- Explicitly outline automated and manual testing you expect engineers to execute; call out gaps if testing is not feasible.
- Prefer reuse of existing patterns within the codebase over introducing new abstractions.
- Provide rationale for each major step so engineers and reviewers understand intent.
